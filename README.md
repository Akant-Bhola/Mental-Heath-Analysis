This project analyses data from the Mental Health and Access to Care Survey (MHACS) 2022, provided by Statistics Canada, using Apache Spark in Databricks. The analysis focuses on self-rated mental health, life satisfaction and perceived stress across different demographic groups, such as age, gender and marital status.

The project involves extracting, transforming and cleaning the data, followed by detailed visualisations to uncover key insights, demonstrating how data can be used to derive actionable insights on mental health trends.
